# TDP019 - Project: Computer Language

The course will run for the entire semester. We will spend the first period of the course teaching you to use your own language, which will be discussed in groups. We will write a grammar for the language. Some of the theory from the parallel course you are reading, TDP007, will be used in this course. We will also have some exercises on grammar and syntax.

The second period of the course will be spent implementing the language with help from Ruby, which you have learned in TDP007, "Construction of Computer Languages." You can find a link to previous years' students' projects on the menu to the left.

Also, we will have a communication module with exercises on oral and written communication. The project will culminate with a presentation before the whole class and a proper documentation of the language you have implemented.

Weight is also put on discussing and comparing different languages, as well as examining and discussing the code you write
